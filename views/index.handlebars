      <p>
        &Tab; Since an adolescent, I have been fascinated with technology, computers, and the world wide web. I made
        static webpages in my youth and even got to deploy some flash-centric wonders. Over the years my love of
        technology and computers only grew more powerful; occassionally doing activites on FreeCodeCamp and taking
        computer science courses at the local community college.
        Most recently I have been attending a Coding Bootcamp, by Trilogy/UC Davis Continuing Education, on the path to
        becoming a full stack web developer. I hope to continue to grow as a web developer and as a person.</p>
      <p>
        &Tab; Please take a look around at my portfolio and if maybe you like what you see, shoot me an email. Hope to
        hear from you! Have a wonderful day =]

        possibly
        others as a career. See my growth as web developer throughout this website.</p>
